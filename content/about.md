Hello!

I'm wiser, a programmer who loves simple code and programming languages and I am currently an engineer for backend development.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/wiserfz/) or send me [an email](mailto:wiserfz810@gmail.com).

I also like cooking, watching movie or animanga, reading, â€¦ However, I am good at cooking. In this case, I am a dabbler in life, too.
